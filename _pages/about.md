I am an Economist turned programmer and about to finish my PhD at the University of
Bonn. I love building complex models of human behavior to analyze policy relevant
questions. Applications range from [structural econometrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01115) to [epidemiology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11129).


Over time, I have authored several open source Python packages. The most popular is
[estimagic](https://estimagic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), a library for numerical
optimization and calibration of scientific models. I am also an active member of the
[Open Source Economics](https://open-econ.org/) initiative.

In my free time I build pizza ovens, bandsaws or furniture and enjoy long bike rides.
