Hi! My name is Jano≈õ, I am an economist and open-source contributor.

I have a passion for using and creating tools. A few years ago, I started
[estimagic](https://estimagic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), a package for difficult numerical optimization problems.

I am fascinated by recent developments in AI. I want to work on the next generation
of tools that help developers and scientists to be faster an create more and better things!

I teach software engineering and deep learning to economists at the University of Bonn.

When I am not working, I enjoy building pizza ovens, bandsaws, and furniture.
