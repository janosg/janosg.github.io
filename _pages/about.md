Hi! My name is Jano≈õ, I am an economist and open-source contributor.

I have a passion for using and creating tools. A few years ago, I started
[estimagic](https://estimagic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), a package for difficult numerical optimization problems.

In my next project, I am exploring how AI can change the way researchers from academia and
industry learn from data. I want to work on the next generation of tools that make empirical research faster and more reproducible.

I teach "Effective Programming Practices for Economists" and "Scientific Computing" at the University of Bonn.

When I am not working, I enjoy building pizza ovens, bandsaws, and furniture.
